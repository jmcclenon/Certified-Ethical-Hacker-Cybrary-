As the amount of cyber threats continue to grow, so does the Cyber Security industry. The need for capable ethical hackers is a global need. Ethical hackers are “white-hat” hackers (aka the good guys) that penetrate secured systems to highlight flaws and weaknesses in a system. They help government agencies, private businesses and public organizations identify what is secure and what needs to be fixed. If the idea of hacking as a career excites you, you’ll benefit greatly from completing Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking training here on Cybrary.

Learning objectives include Intrusion Detection, Policy Creation, Social Engineering, DDoS Attacks, Buffer Overflows and Virus Creation. At the conclusion of this training class, you’ll be able to create an effective vulnerability prevention strategy to prevent the attackers from entering your system.
