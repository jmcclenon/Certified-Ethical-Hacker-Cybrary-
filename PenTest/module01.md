### 5 Phases of Penetration Testing

#### Introduction Transcript: (Edited)

Welcome my name is Leo Dregier, welcome to the penetration 
testing course. We’re going to cover some beginner concepts 
some intermediate concepts and some advanced concepts. 

In this module I want to cover the different phases 
of penetration testing.

**Phase one** is your reconnaissance, which can be done actively 
or passively. Basically meaning you can passively find information 
about your host either going through an intermediary, or you can 
actively directly reach out and touch your target. 

**Phase two** is scanning this is where we try to find more information 
about our host. We’re using disclosure to our advantage here. 
This is where we start doing our port scanners and our vulnerability 
scanners and we try to find as much detail as we can about our host

In **phase three** we gain access. This is where we actually perform 
the hack or the exploit. 

In **phase four**, we maintain that access.

In **phase five** we cover our tracks. 

So these phases of penetration testing that happen over and over and over again 
1-2-3-4-5 1-2-3-4-5 and it is important to look at the subject matter of penetration 
testing as a **cyclic process**. 

Anything after that cyclic process is really a la-carte, in the sense that you can 
perform SQL injection, you can go after aweb server, or you can crack a password.

You can run different types of exploits. 

But nonetheless the major phases of penetration testing is always rinse and repeat. 

**Phase 1 - reconnaissance
Phase 2 - scanning
Phase 3 - gaining access
Phase 4 - maintaining that access
Phase 5 - covering your tracks or writing your reports. **

That will cover the introduction of the penetration testing. 
There’s lots to cover here so let's dig into the core detail.

### 1. Reconnaissance (footprinting)

Footprinting is the most critical component of Penetration Testing in that 
the **information naturally reveals itself**. Footprinting empowers accurate, 
on-point documentation and fact-finding of every target type from IP addresses, 
access points, systems, rogue websites to ID adverse activities which is the 
foundation needed for accurate penetration testing. 

In this module, you’ll learn all the key focus points, targets, and the 
key tools that enable successful Footprinting as you conduct penetration testing.  

For example, the early segment focuses on documentation, what to target and how to 
document it.  Then you’ll learn about advanced techniques such as alerting websites 
that will facilitate info to come to you instead of you searching for it.

The topics covered in this module are as follows:

In this module I want to talk about the various aspects of footprinting. 

Footprinting is a very important concept in the world of penetration 
testing because information is **naturally disclosed everywhere**,
so, **what the penetration tester does is document all of this 
information**.

The information comes from a variety of sources**. 

Some of the information is going to be about our target, for example it could 
be our **organizational websites, directories, anything regarding email**. 

Ultimately we are going to have to reach out and touch a 
system, so this is where **IP addresses, domain name blocks, websites,
access points** all become very, very important. 

Some of the threats that are possible with just footprinting could 
be be used in a **social engineering attack**. 

Could the clients be subjected to a financial loss of some sort?

So we are going to cover a lot of the tools and techniques that we would actually 
use. Most of these are available over the internet. 

At least I would start there. These would include things like 
job sites or anything that is on the internet.

**Job sites, social networks, posting boards**, and things like that. 

In the beginning part of the footprinting. It is really about
**documenting all of this**. 

But we are also going to cover some of the advanced techniques as well,
and I will show how. Instead of you having to go find information about 
your target, the advanced concept is you **want the information to 
come find you**. And I will show you how you can use alerting websites for that. 

The biggest component here that we are going to use to dissect our target 
is going to be **public registration of our target which is the DNS information 
and the Whois information**. We will **use email to our advantage**,
as well. That will cover the basics of footprinting. 

Now let us get into the really good detail.
