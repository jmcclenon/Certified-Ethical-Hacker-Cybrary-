##5 Phases of Penetration Testing

###Introduction Transcript:

Welcome my name is Leo Dregier, welcome to the penetration testing course 
we’re going to cover some beginner concepts some intermediate concepts and some 
advanced concepts. In this module I want to cover the different phases of penetration testing. 
Phase one is your reconnaissance, which can be done actively or passively. 
Basically meaning you can passively find information about your host either going 
through an intermediary or you can actively directly reach out and touch your target. 

Phase two is scanning this is where we try to find more information about our host. 
We’re using disclosure to our advantage here. This is where we start doing our port 
scanners and our vulnerability scanners and we try to find as much detail as we can 
about our host then in phase three we have gaining access. This is where we actually 
perform the hack or the exploit. 

Then we maintain that access and then we will finally 
finish with phase five which is covering our tracks. So these phases of penetration 
testing that happen over and over and over again 1-2-3-4-5 1-2-3-4-5 and it is important 
to look at the subject matter of penetration testing as a cyclic process. 
Anything after that cyclic process is really a la-carte in the sense of you can 
perform SQL injection, you can go after web server you can crack a password, 
you can run different types of exploits. 

But nonetheless the major phases of 
penetration testing is always rinse and repeat. 
Phase 1 reconnaissance, phase 2 scanning, phase 3 gaining access, 
phase 4 maintaining that access, and then phase 5, is covering your tracks or 
writing your reports. That will cover the introduction of the penetration testing. 
There’s lots to cover here so let us dig in to the core detail.

##1. Reconnaissance (footprinting)

Footprinting is the most critical component of Penetration Testing in that the information naturally reveals itself.  
Footprinting empowers accurate, on-point documentation and fact-finding of every target type from IP addresses, 
access points, systems, rogue websites to ID adverse activities which is the foundation needed for accurate penetration testing.
In this module, you’ll learn all the key focus points, targets, and the key tools that enable successful Footprinting 
as you conduct penetration testing.  For example, the early segment focuses on documentation, what to target and how to 
document it.  Then you’ll learn about advanced techniques such as alerting websites that will facilitate info to come 
to you instead of you searching for it.

The topics covered in this module are as follows:

Hi, My name is Leo Dregier, in this module I want to talk about the various aspects of footprinting. 
Footprinting is a very important concept in the world of penetration testing because information is 
naturally disclosed everywhere and so what the penetration tester does is that he documents all of this 
information and the information can come from a variety of sources. So some of the information is going 
to be about our target, for example it could be our organizational websites, directories, anything 
regarding email. 

Ultimately we are going to have to reach out and we are going to touch a system so 
this is where IP addresses domain name blocks row websites – access points. All become very very important. 
Some of the threats that are possible with just foot printing in itself is could the information that you 
have gained here. Could that be used in a social engineering attack? Could the clients be subjected to a 
financial loss of some sort. So we are going to cover a lot of the tools and techniques that we would actually 
use. Most of these are available over the internet. 

At least I would start there. These would include things 
like job sites or anything that is realistically on the internet. Job sites, social networks, posting boards, 
and things like that. Now in the beginning part of the foot printing. It is really documenting all of this. 
But we are also going to cover some of the advanced techniques as well and I will show how. Instead of you 
having to go find information about your target. Well the advanced concept is you want the information to 
come find you. And I will show you how you can use learning websites for that. 

The biggest component here that we are going to use to dissect our target is going to be public 
registration of our target which is the DNS information and the Whois information. Also we are 
going to use email to our advantage as well. So that will cover the basics of foot printing. 

Now let us get into the really good detail.
